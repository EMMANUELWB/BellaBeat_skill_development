BellaBeat Activity Data Analysis 🏃‍♀️📊

I recently explored the BellaBeat activity dataset to uncover patterns in how users move throughout the week. Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard that shows trends in daily steps, calories burned, and how much time people spend being active or sedentary. Excel helped with the data cleaning part before diving into visuals.

🛠️ Tools I Used
• Tableau – for creating charts and the final dashboard
• Excel – for cleaning and prepping the raw data

📈 Insights I Found
• The most active day of the week turned out to be Tuesday
• Sunday was the least active day
• Users spend a lot more time being sedentary than being active
• There’s a clear link between how many steps someone takes and the calories they burn
• Activity levels (light, moderate, very active) are quite different across users

🎯 Why I Did This
This was part of building my portfolio and practicing my data skills. I wanted to better understand real-world health data and present it in a way that’s visual and easy to explore.
